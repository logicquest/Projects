This folder comprises all my works  android projects.

Project I: ALGO

This project contains my implementation of my thesis Visually Impaired Person's Navigation System. Three features in 
an android application will help a visually impaired person to go through his route. 

Features:
Voice Location:
  By pressing a button, the visually impaired person is alerted about his present location via voice.
  
Outdoor Navigation:
  Once, the visually impaired person enters his route information via voice request, he will be assisted with direction 
  information via voice.
  
Emergency Management:
  The visually impaired person can trigger his friend or any person who has registered to help, in terms of an emergency.
  Online monitoring of his location can be watched online using an interactive map feature.
  
Project II: Arrived Now:

ArrivedNow,a GeoAlarm application that will alert you when you reach your destination based on the location set.

Project III: Open Sudoku (Implemented using Google Cloud Messaging)

This is a collaborative sudoku application, where users join to play a sudoku game. All instructions are clearly specified 
in GCM zip, readme file.

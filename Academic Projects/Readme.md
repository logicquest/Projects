This repository consists of all my projects done during my coursework


Files and Projects Description:

In Academic Projects, I have listed 3 projects. 

Backpropogation Algorithm:

Backpropagation, an abbreviation for "backward propagation of errors", is a common method of training artificial neural
networks used in conjunction with an optimization method such as gradient descent. The method calculates the gradient
of a loss function with respects to all the weights in the network. The gradient is fed to the optimization method
which in turn uses it to update the weights, in an attempt to minimize the loss function.

I have implemented EPOCH version of this algorithm.

This approach often yields a network with a lower residual error. When you train the network you should calculate 
the deltas for each layer for every instance of the dataset, and then finally average the individual deltas and
correct the weights once per epoch.

Churn Ratio Implementation:

Measuring the lines of code has always been a metric to determine the code efficiency and quality. In this project, I 
have implemented a metric called Churn ratio which gives more precise measurement. It considers lot of factors like 
code duplication, extra lines added on an entire project to evalaute any project's dependencies.

Modelling Background Knowledge to preseve privacy when publishing Data:

This project enhances the privacy and security for Background Knowledge Attack.The model implemented can judge the Background Knowledge 
according to Adversaryâ€™s level thereby maintaining trade-off between privacy and utility.
